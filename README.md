# GraphLaplacian

A set of codes for the exploration and visualization of the eigen properties of a graph

1. Constructing graph objects from a variety of inputs ( bespoke dicts, dot files) into a bespoke graph object or a pydot graph obj or a networkxx graph object 

2. Convert some graph objects to numpy arrays as distance matrix

3. Calculate and display the mathematical properties of those matrix

4. use javascripts to provide animations on those
